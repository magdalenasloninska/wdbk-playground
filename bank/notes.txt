Improvements:
1. If a user signs up successfully they should be redirected to the homepage (currently login page)?
2. Displaying transfer history (chronologically by default)
3. Add sections to navbar: "Send transfer", "History"
4. ...

Ad 1. The order is actually:
 - Sign up page
 - (Upon success) redirect to homepage
 - the user is technically still not logged in, so redirect to login page
 - (Upon successful login) homepage

Ad 3. We would like to separate the existing hompage into to separate sections:
 - "Send transfer" with a form that contains transfer title, recipient and amount as well as displays us as the sender.
   Submitting this form should result in a redirect to confirm our data.
   Confirming this information is the final step (here we can see what's been sent to the server).
 - "History" is just a more advanced table.
