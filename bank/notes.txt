Improvements:
1. If a user signs up successfully they should be redirected to the homepage (currently login page)?
2. Displaying transfer history (chronologically by default)
3. Add sections to navbar: "Send transfer", "History"
4. ...

Ad 1. The order is actually:
 - Sign up page
 - (Upon success) redirect to homepage
 - the user is technically still not logged in, so redirect to login page
 - (Upon successful login) homepage

Ad 3. We would like to separate the existing hompage into to separate sections:
 - "Send transfer" with a form that contains transfer title, recipient and amount as well as displays us as the sender.
   Submitting this form should result in a redirect to confirm our data.
   Confirming this information is the final step (here we can see what's been sent to the server).
 - "History" is just a more advanced table.

Google login requires a few steps:
1. Register the app with Google and generate appropriate credentials (Client ID)
2. Add new functions to auth.py (login + callback)
3. ...

For now let's say that logging in via Google is an alternate path (separate link on navbar).

New user for testing secret token: test@mail (password: test)
And another: test2@mail (password: test)

Regarding 2FA there are two workflows we have to implement:
1. setting up 2FA (as a logged-in user) when it was not previously enabled and entering the OTP for the first time
2. using 2FA every time the user wants to log in after that

How to tackle adding an admin role (that would have to the ability to actually execute transfers)?

We know we'll have to modify some of our models:
 - Transfer: add boolean field for whether the transfer has already been executed or if it's still waiting

 New user for testing bank admin privileges: admin@mail (password: test)
